# Project Mullet ![](./app/images/logo.png)

HairDoneWright530 is located in Olivehurst, California and is privately owned by 
Melissa Wright. The HairDoneWright530 app is designed to connect Melissa with her clients and the clients to Melissa by providing an easy to use User Interface (UI) for use in the app. This app will help drive business to HairDoneWright530 by providing to the community a state licensed cosmetologistsâ€™s services in one application. The Administrator side of the app allows for booking appointments and changing of appointments, selection of clienttell, integrated schedule setting, customized notes and information for contacting clients, and for clients they can book and see available times Melissa has for appointments while also providing a convenient, and easy to use selection of available services. 

This project is being completed by a team from Sacramento State University called the Recycling Team as part of a Senior Project over the time span of 2 semesters.

## Project Flow (EERD)

![Project Mullet EERD Diagram](./app/images/Demo_Images/ProjectMulletEERD.png)

## Installation

To install and run the project on your computer you will need to first clone the project on your local machine in the manor you wish either by downloading the source code or by using the provided command below. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CanadaAndrew/Project-Mullet
```

In addition to the listed dependencies below you will need npm and to create a expo app to run the app in.

```bash
npx expo install expo-linear-gradient
npm install --save react-native-calendars
npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens expo-linking expo-constants expo-status-bar react-native-gesture-handler
npm install react-native-dropdown-select-list
npm install axios
npm install mssql
npm install express
npm install cors
npm install moment-timezone
npm install @react-native-community/datetimepicker --save
npm install firebase
npm install @expo/vector-icons
npm install react-native-vector-icons
npm install firebase
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
npm install react-native-root-toast
```

## Setting up the Simulators

In order to run the project and properly test it youw will have to have a simulator available for expo to run the react native app on. There are many choices how you go about this but, my team used and tested on 2 different methods; IOS Simulator and Android.

### Android Simulator

The android simulator takes a bit more work to get running than the ios simulator but it has a lot of options for how you go about running the app on the simulator. Firrst you will need to download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install). Android Studio as of writing this section (5/1/24) runs on Windows, Some distros of Linux (Ubuntu), Mac OS, and Chrome OS. 

After downloading and installing Android Studio you will need to install a device to simulate Android on. The app should be fine for most versions of android devices such as Pixel phones. 

When launching the development server you will need to activate the simulator first and then click 'a' in the terminak for development server so that it starts launching the expo app on the andoid simulator.

### IOS Simulator

In order to run the IOS simualtor you will need either a IOS device or a Mac capable of running the IOS simulator (Most modernish Macs should be able to). The next step after securing a mac would be to go to the App Store and download [X-Code](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). 

Once in X-Code you will need to go to the settings page and from there platforms where you can select the version number and what kind of device you would like to simulate on. Then download the platform/device. You can either go to your simulators (Will appear in your application froms now on) or when lauching the developement server just click 'i' to load the app in the simulator and it should automatically activate and load the app into the simulator.


## Running the Program

To deploy this project type in the terminal:

```bash
npm run
```
Or you can type:

```bash
npx expo start
```
Both of these commands should start the prject and bring you to wall of text with a
QR code that you can scan to run the app on your phone. We recommend you use 'npx expo start'. If you don't want to run this project on your phone using the QR code you can download a simulator and run it locally.
